# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Classification using CNN + Transfer Learning

This project uses MobileNetV2 with transfer learning to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow. It includes model training, performance visualization, and Grad-CAM explainability.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2)
- Data Augmentation
- CNN Model Training
- Grad-CAM Heatmaps
- Model Accuracy/Loss Visualization

## 📊 Results
- Achieved ~XX% accuracy on validation set
- Grad-CAM highlights areas the model focused on

## 🔧 How to Run
1. Clone the repo or open in Colab
2. Run the notebook cell by cell

## 📁 Files
- `cats_vs_dogs_cnn.ipynb`: Main notebook
- `sample_images/`: Example predictions and Grad-CAM visualizations
